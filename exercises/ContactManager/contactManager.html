<!--We are building a contact manager where user can create contacts by specifying name and email. Search them and delete them.

Add two text fields to take input of Name and Email from the user
A button to add contact, clicking on this button will validate name and email. If both name and email are present and email is valid against a regexp, add a contact box on the page. This box would contain the information entered by the user.
Include a Delete button in the contact on clicking which the contact can be deleted.
Create one search field for searching the contacts from their names only. It should filter/search contacts as I start typing in the search box i.e. realtime.
When the search field is empty, all the contacts should be displayed.
